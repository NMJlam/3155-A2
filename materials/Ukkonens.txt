Suffix extension: 

Case 1: 
- Addition of a number into the node (this indicates that a new letter has been created) 

Case 2a: Node already exists
- Where there is already a node, such that there is a mismatch at a point "x" at the end of the path 
	such that it mismatches with the current suffix, we extend the node by 1 additional character 

Case 2b: No Node exists
- When there is no node which exists, we create a new node to show that split along the path 

Case 3:
- Do nothing at all as the suffix is already in the tree and will be created in the final stage 
- Whenever this rule is hit STOP immediately (Showstopper rule)

Suffix Links:

- Only applicable to rule 2, where new internal nodes are created

For a path called XA
	x - the first character in the path of the string to a current node 
	Alpha - the remainder of the string after removing x  
Node variables: 
	- Active Node (AN): The node that you have most recently traversed.
	- Pending Node(PN): The node that is yet to have a suffix link (most recently created node). 
	- Extension Point (EP): The point in the tree where the next rule 2 extension are applied. 

Always point the pending node to node to the extension point.
